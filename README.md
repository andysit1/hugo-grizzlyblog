# Hugo  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î Grizzly Bear Blog ![Test](https://github.com/andysit1/my-hugo-site/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

üß∏ A [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)-theme based on [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev).

> Free, no-nonsense, super-fast blogging.

This theme is my custom theme I will be building over hugo bear blogs. Updated regularly whenever my personal website is updated.

## Demo

For a current & working demo of this theme, please check out http://www.andysit.com/ üéØ.

## Installation

If you already have a Hugo site on your machine, you can simply add this theme via

```bash
git https://github.com/andysit1/my-hugo-theme.git themes/hugo-grizzlyblog
```

Then, adjust the `hugo.toml` as detailed below.

For more information, read the official [setup guide][hugo-setup-guide] of Hugo.

## Content & structure

### Starting fresh

If you are starting fresh, simply copy over the contents of the `exampleSite`-directory included in this theme to your source directory. That should give you a good idea about how things work, and then you can go on from there to make the site your own.

### Adding / editing content

#### Index-Page

The contents of the `index`-page may be changed by editing your `content/_index.md`-file.

#### Page

You can add **a new page** via running

```bash
hugo new my-new-page.md
```

#### Blog-Post

You can add **a new blog-post** via running

```bash
hugo new blog/my-new-post.md
```
