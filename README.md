# my-hugo-theme
hugo theme for personal website built on top of Bear Blog by Jan Raasch.

I wanted to tweak the typography of the website, but the issue was I had the original repo as a submodule which messed up the workflow. This way I can update and change the code in a different repo and submodule it back into my-hugo-site when I'm ready.
